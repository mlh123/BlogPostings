Back again for our next instalment, it's great to have you join back with the colony.

A website. Why would a honey making company need a website? Well, to be trusted and recognised by potential customers, you need to have an online presence, whether that be through Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or by the old-fashioned way of a simple website. Its your choice, but we recommend all four to create the best user experience, all with links to each other. 

With the help of **[Themeisle](https://themeisle.com/blog/do-i-need-a-website-for-my-business/)**, we are going to show you why a website is needed.

1. **A website makes you look professional**

   By making it cohesive with your social media platforms, it helps create a strong brand image that customers are more likely to trust and respect. You could go the extra mile and create a branded email address to increase your level of professionalism.
2. **You can clearly showcase your products and services**

   Using high-quality images and/or videos of your goods/services that fit with the desired aesthetic that you're going for add to helping you attract the right sort of customer. Our 'right customers' are those who are interested in the health, wellbeing and preservation of our bee community and an appetite for honey. 
3. **People can leave reviews of your good and services**

   This is a great way to establish social proof that your company is legitimate and of high quality. By publishing your best reviews, its secondary purpose serves as a permanent archive that third-parties, potential clients and partners can have access to. 
4. **It encourages customers to directly contact you**

   A website is a great platform to make your contact information readily accessible to potential customers who wish to get in contact regarding any queries or questions. In case you're worried about SPAM, most modern website builders provide you a template of a contact form to protect your business email.
5. **It established your place in the industry**

   Heard of early bird catches the worm? Well, that same incentive applies to this situation as well. By establishing yourself either first, you have a greater potential to establish yourself as the leader in your field, if your competitors are already online, then you have the opportunity to diverse yours to make it stand out. 
6. **Creating a website is getting easier and easier, and better yet, cheaper!**

   Squarespace and Wix are just some of the well-known modern website builders that make it easy for you to build an attractive, mobile-friendly site without any previous knowledge of code. Now you can build a website, where the core software is 100% free with WordPress, there are other packages you can utilise to get it up and running for a very low cost.

So, to answer the question on everyone's minds, *A website, should I or not?* 

The answer is...yes!

It's quick, easy and cheap to do so. 

You've got to believe in yourself like we at ***Holden Honey Hives*** do.

See you **bees** next week for: *Recipe books: are they popular? Honey, we hope so.\*

Until then, dream big and live well.
