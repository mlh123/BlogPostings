Back again for our next instalment, it's great to have you join back in with the **colony**.

Fun fact of the week: Bumblebees have surprisingly smelly feet! 

A website. Why would an amazing honey making company, like us, need a website? Well, to be trusted and recognised by potential buyers, that's why. 

To have this, you need to have an online presence. It's that simple, stylish, yet effective.

Whether it be through *Instagram, Facebook, Twitter* or by the old-fashioned way of a simple website, it's your choice. 

We utilise and recommend all four to create the best user experience, all with links to each other. 

With the help of **[Themeisle](https://themeisle.com/blog/do-i-need-a-website-for-my-business/)**, we are going to show you why a website is needed.

1. **A website makes you look professional, who doesn't want to be taken seriously when it comes down to bee-siness?** 

   Keeping it cohesive with your social media platforms creates a strong brand image that customers are more likely to **swarm** to trust and respect. You could go the extra mile and create a branded email address to showcase that you're a force to **bee** reckoned with.
2. **You can cluster together your products and services to attract the perfect bee.**

   It's an **alighting board** for you to present high-quality images and/or videos of your goods/services that fit with the right look that will bring in the right sort of customer. Our 'right customers' are those who are interested in the health, wellbeing and preservation of our lustrous bee community, and those who have an appetite for honey. 
3. **People can leave reviews of your good and services, just imagine the amazing responses!**

   This is a great way to establish social proof that your company is legitimate and of high quality, wouldn't want to be seen as a **wasp**. 
4. **It encourages bees to directly contact the apiarist (aka. the beekeeper, aka. you).**

   Your contact information is readily accessible, on a website, to potential customers who wish to get in touch. In case you're worried about SPAM, most modern website builders provide you a template of a contact form to protect your business email, bet that's a **pollen load** off your shoulders.
5. **It establishes your place in the hierarchy of the hive.**

   Heard of early bird catches the worm? Well, that same incentive applies to this situation as well. By establishing yourself first, you have a greater potential to establish yourself as the leader in your field. If your competitors are already online, then you have the opportunity to diverse yours to make it stand out. 
6. **Creating a website is getting easier and easier, and better yet, cheaper!**

   *Squarespace* and *Wix* are just some of the well-known modern website builders that make it easy for you to build an attractive, mobile-friendly site. Coding is scary and confusing, luckily these do that for you! 

So, to answer the question on everyone's minds, *A website, should I or not?* 

The answer is...yes!

It's quick, easy and cheap to do so. 

You've got to **bee-**lieve in yourself like we at ***Holden Honey Hives*** do.

See you **bees** next week for: *Recipe books: are they popular? Honey, we hope so.*

Until then, dream big and live well.
