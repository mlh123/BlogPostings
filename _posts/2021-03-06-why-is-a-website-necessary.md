A website. Why would a honey making company need a website? Well, to be trusted and recognised by potential customers, you need to have an online presence, whether that be through Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or by the old-fashioned way of a simple website. Its your choice, but we recommend all four to create the best user experience, all with links to each other. 

With the help of **[Themeisle](https://themeisle.com/blog/do-i-need-a-website-for-my-business/)**, we are going to show you why a website is needed.

1. **A website makes you look professional**

   By making it cohesive with your social media platforms, it helps create a strong brand image that customers are more likely to trust and respect. You could go the extra mile and create a branded email address to increase your level of professionalism.
2. **You can clearly showcase your products and services**

   Using high-quality images and/or videos of your goods/services that fit with the desired aesthetic that you're going for add to helping you attract the right sort of customer. Our 'right customers' are those who are interested in the health, wellbeing and preservation of our bee community and an appetite for honey.
