Welcome back to the **hive,** how has the outside world **bee-n** treating you?

Last week we looked at why the cover is important, not only as a marketing tool, but also as a sales tool. This week we are looking into where people get their recipes from. 

We have a very niche focus for ours, honey. If it doesn't inculde honey, then it ain't going in our book. Simple as. However, because its niche-ness, finding recipes that haven't been done to death was a challenge, but a challenge we were determined to overcome. 

We collated a number of unique and diverse recipes from a variety of sources, from *[CookEatShare](https://cookeatshare.com)* to *[A Basic Cook](http://www.abasiccook.com).* These provided to basis, we then shared these recipes on our social media platforms to get our audience to try them out at home. Their response was invaluable and extemely positive. We asked them what food combinations with honey that they wanted to try and what ones that were classic family favourites.
