Welcome to the **bee-hive** of Holden Honey Hive. 

We welcome all those who love and appreicuate vees like we do. 

To those who don't, **buzz** off.

Today's conversation of choice is generating an idea for your recipe book.

Inspiration can turn up in the unlikliest of places, a simple walk through a meadow to being chased down a rickettey old bridge by a lion. 

You may think: this meadow has a pungent smell, maybe I should make a cookbook book filled with stinky reicipes to try out.

Or you may think: that lion looks hungry and I don't want to be its next meal, maybe I make a cookbook on ways to turn from a carnavor to a herbivor in a few easy steps. And quickly!

Now all the serious stuff is out of the way, let us tell you how we came up with our recipe book idea.
