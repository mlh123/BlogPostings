Welcome to the **bee-hive** of Holden Honey Hive. 

We welcome all those who love and appreciate bees like we do. 

To those who don't, **buzz** off.

We need bees. Not just us at ***Holden Honey Hives*** as that essential for our family run and owned honey business, but because the world would be a much duller place without them.

With the help of **\*Friends of the Earth**,* we are going to show you just some of the reasons why bees are so important.

Did you know that, according to *Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)*:

> "*More than 90% of the leading global crop types are visited by bees.*" 

That's not surprising once you find out that there are over 20,000 known species of bees globally, and our personally favourite is the renowned **Honeybee**. There are 25 **Bumblebee** species and over 220 types of **Solitary Bees**, and yes, these tend to nest on their own, as their name implies. 

Bees bring joy into our lives without us even registering it. We appreciate their strong work ethic. Their ability to never let us down. Without them, there'd be no us. 

When you're looking outside and see the blooming array of colourful and vibrant flowers, just remember, without bees, that wouldn't be possible. Current times are depressing and dull as it is, and as we're entering spring time, we need a little joy and happiness to get us through these times. 

Through lockdown, the world has grown a deeper appreciation for the great outdoors, but with the worryingly dropping numbers of bees, something needs to be done.  

Organisations and charities such as *[Friends of the Earth](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/nature/why-do-we-need-bees), [Bumblebee Conservation Trust](https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org),* and *[The British Bee Charity](https://www.britishbeecharity.com)* are just some of the many that are working tirelessly to make a positive change.

Here at ***Holden Honey Hives*** it has become one of our main objectives to do something about this, to not only help our own community, but to help all that we can thrive. That's why we decided to release our recipe book:

> *Holden Honey Hives Presents Our Family Guide to Cooking with Honey*

Week by week, we are going to show you the process we went through in creating this honey-based recipe book and hope that it may inspire you to thrive for success with an objective of helping others. 

See you next week for: *Hive got an idea, have you?*
