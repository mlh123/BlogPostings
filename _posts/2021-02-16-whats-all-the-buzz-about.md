Welcome back to the **hive** ~ how have you **bee-n**?

From our previous posts, you should now all have a running theme and idea on what your product and/or service should revolve around.

Let's use Holden Honey Hives as our case study today to provide you with working example to review.

A cover has to be engaging, eye-catching, and most importantly, relevent.

It may take hours, days, months, years. Or it might take minutes, seconds. You might get it right first attempt, you may not. These things take time and shouldn't be rushed, unless the **Queen Bee** orders it. When it happens, you'll know. You'll think "that's the one".

Creating a cover involves miniscule changes using Adobe progammes such as Photoshop and Indesign, in this working example.
