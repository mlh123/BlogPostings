Welcome back my beehive ~ how have you **bee-n**?

All good things, I hope. 

Fun fact of the week: honey is 80% sugar and 20% water, and ours is 100% made from love.

Here at ***Holden Honey Hive***, we have one theme that runs throughout all of our products. Can you guess what it is? Here's a hint, it is in our title.

It's what gets the world **buzzing**. It's what makes people **bumble** out of bed in the morning.

We can keep **drone**-ing on about what it can do all day long, but for your benefit, we'll give.

The essence of pollination...honey. Ding! Ding! Ding!

Here at our family-run **bees-**ness, honey is our **nectar** of life. We pride ourselves on producing the highest quality of honey that we possibly can, we don't just **wing** it.

A theme is what keeps an identity, a brand, a business alive. Whether that theme is the most **buzzare** thing in the world or that the theme is that there is no theme. It is a crucial that you know, so that your product or service can be targeted to the ideal **colony** that it deserves.

To get an idea of what your theme should **bee**, you need to ask yourself: 

> *What am I trying to achieve?*

Whether your goal is the be the market leader in the honey world or to be the most **buzzed** about fungal nail cream, it's equally important for everyone to try and **bee** as successful as possible in our endeavours.

Here are ways in which may help you decide upon a theme and apply it, according to *[Blurb](https://www.blurb.com/blog/10-tips-creating-cookbook/)*:

1. Aim for simplicity and go from there, **bee-ing** basic can get you a long way.
2. **Bee** consistent, do not make carefully designed elements look like an accident.
3. Know your chapters and section in advance to create a uni**\-flyed** product.
4. Choose the right trim size, the **buzz cut** helps create a more professional look.
5. Create your reci-**bee** layouts in advance to get the most out of the proportions.
6. Write engaging recipe headnotes, the readers will love this extra attention to detail, it shan't be too sha-**bee**.
7. Use less food than you would serve and save the rest for yourselves, **bee**-ing this amazing is hard work.
8. To prevent the photos from looking bland and boring, **hive** it up a bit by varying up your locations and plating backgrounds.
9. Take photos in natural lighting for them to look as aesthetically pleasing as possible in the eyes of the **bee**-holder.
10. Test, re-test and proofread it to weed out any mistakes, because you'll have missed at least one, ain't nothing worse then messing up in the **spelling bee** of life.

A theme is important to any product, but it is especially relevant for a reci-**bee** book because you have to compete with the **wasps** on the internet. Why should a potential customer and reader purchase your recipe book when there are similar recipes available for free online? You are creating a user experience; you are creating value for money. A consistent theme will help you accomplish this.

Now, here at ***Holden Honey Hives***, we hope this was helpful in your search for a theme.

We look forward to seeing you in our next week's issue of: *Gathering recipes, we've been busy bees!*

For now, our glorious beehive, fly away and enjoy the rest of your day.
