Welcome back my beehive ~ how have you **bee-n**?

I hope you have been

Here at Holden Honey Hive, we have one theme that runs throughout all of our products. Can you guess what it is? Here's a hint, it is in our title.

It's what gets the world **buzzing**. It's what makes people **bumble** out of bed in the morning.

We can keep **drone**-ing on about what it can do all day long, but for your benefit, we'll give.

The essence of pollination...honey. Ding! Ding! Ding!

Here at our family-run business, honey is our **nectar** of life. We pride ourselves on producing the highest quality of honey that we possibly can, we don't just **wing** it.

A theme is what keeps an identity, a brand, a business alive. Whether that theme is the most **buzzare** thing in the world or that the theme is that there is no theme. It is a crucial that you know, so that your product or service can be targeted to the ideal **colony** that it deserves.

To get an idea of what your theme should **bee**, you need to ask yourself: 

*What am I trying to achieve?*

Whether your goal is the be the market leader in the honey world or to be the most **buzzed** about fungle nail cream, it's equally important for everyone to try and **bee** as successful as possible in our endevours.
