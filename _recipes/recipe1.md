* 1 or 1/2 Mangos (pitted, peeled and diced)  
* 1 Banana 
* A handful of baby spinach
* 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds
* 2 tablespoons of honey
* 1 cup of cold water or ice cubes

## Method

1. Chop up the banana and place into the **bee**-lender with the pitted, peeled and diced up mango.
2. Add in a handful of spinach and the ground flax seeds, which are high in Omego and fibre, to keep the **hive** fuller for longer.
3. Pour the honey over the ingredients, then either add the water or ice to the mixture and **bee-**lend until smooth.
4. This is where the honorary food testers (aka:**worker bees**) come and check to see if any more honey is needed.
5. When the right concoction has been made, serve for all to enjoy it.

   *Can be kept in the fridge for a day.*

* Serves: 1
