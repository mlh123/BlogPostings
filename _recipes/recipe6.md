Serves: 4

Preparation Time: 25 minutes

Cooking Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

¼ cup of unsalted butter

1 & ½ cups of milk

2 large eggs

6 slices of white country bread

½ cup + 1 tablespoon of honey

5 tablespoons of hot water

¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon of vanilla

### Method:

1. Preheat oven to 180**°**C.
2. Butter 9-inch glass pie dish.
3. Lightly beat eggs.
4. Here's the important job for the **worker bees**: tare the slices of bread into 1 inch squares with the crust.
5. Whisk together the milk and eggs, then add the bread pieces and create **capping's** surrounding them evenly. 
6. Leave the bread to soak for 15 to 20 minutes, turning over once or twice.
7. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the remaining butter over medium heat. Then fry the soaked bread in butter until **honey-golden**, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side and then transfer the bread to a baking dish to cover the **frames** and **bottom board**.
8. In a bowl, combine ***Holden Honey Hives*** honey and hot water and stir until the mixture is evenly **bee-**lended. 
9. Stir in the cinnamon and vanilla and drizzle the sauce over and around the bread.
10. Bake for 30 minutes or until **honey-golden** brown.

Attached below is a YouTube video detailing how to create an enjoyabe and cheap desert, why not try replacing the white bread with brown bread, for that added fibre?
