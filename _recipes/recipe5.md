*The day's been long. The day's been tiring. Trust us, our **colony** knows all about that. That's why this nutritious, protein filled dinner is perfect for the whole family. Served with either noodles or rice with vegetables, it rivals being resturant-worthy.*

Serves: 4

Preparation Time: 15 minutes

Cooking Time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

2 Tablespoons of Oyster Sauce

¼ cup of Water

⅓ cup of Honey (runny)

1 Lime (juice and zest)

2 Gloves Garlic Crushed

Salmon Fillet (either one large fillet or 4 individual fillets)

### Method:

1. **Worker bee,** mix together all of the ingredients except the Salmon in a small bowl. 
2. Now, when dealing with heat, it is best not to have the **foundlings** involved here, we don't want them getting **stung**.
3. Preheat the grill to 200 (or high heat).
4. Marinade the salmon fillet(s) for 10 minutes.
5. Place the Salmon on a shallow baking tray and brush with any residual marinade in the bowl.
6. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes, until the salmon is opaque and the top glistening and golden brown.
7. Serve with rice or noodles and vegetables.
