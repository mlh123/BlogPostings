*Ah, brunch. When breakfast just isn't enough but lunch is too far away, what a **bee** to do but eat? With this sensory dish, time won’t matter. It's a tried and tested family favourite, so don’t worry about those fussy little eaters, they’ll be **buzzing** for this zinger of an omelette.*

* Serves: 4
* Preparation Time: 10 minutes 
* Cooking Time: 5 minutes



## Ingredients:

* 6-7 eggs (beaten with a splash of milk)
* 3-4 apples (spelled and sliced)
* 1 cup of shredded cheese
* 3-4 tablespoons of honey (+ more for drizzling)
* 5-6 fresh basil leaves (sliced thin)
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper
* Olive oil

## Method:

1. Crack the eggs in a large bowl with a splash of milk, salt and pepper, and get the **worker bees** to mix together.
2. In a separate bowl, place the sliced apples, shredded cheese, basil and the delicious honey and toss.
3. Heat a round griddle pan with a tablespoon of olive oil. 
4. Then, pour enough batter to almost fit the pan and swirl to make the circle even-ish. 
5. When the eggs become firm, gently loosen with a spatula and crarefully flip (if all goes wrong, make a **beeline** to scrambled eggs).
6. Leave for a few seconds and plate.
7. Fill half of the circle with the apple-honey and cheese mixture and then fold over. Top with an extra apple and drizzle with honey.
8. Serve with a delicous cup of coffee.
